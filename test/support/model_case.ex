  This module defines the test case to be used by
  model tests.

  You may define functions here to be used as helpers in
  your model tests. See `errors_on/2`'s definition as reference.

  Finally, if the test case interacts with the database,
  it cannot be async. For this reason, every test runs
  inside a transaction which is reset at the beginning
  of the test unless the test case is marked as async.
